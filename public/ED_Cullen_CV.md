## ABOUT ME

I thrive on learning and applying knowledge to build solutions that deliver value. I have a natural and unwavering drive for continuous improvement. With an understanding and involvement in mechanical and software engineering, as well as business, I can bring a blend of technical and operational insight. In 2022, I began working on a toolset focused on improving both people and systems, in the tool hire industry. I applied some of the knowledge and experience I had in business operations, logistics and systems design.

I'm currently studying BComputing with a focus on data science and databases, and I'm eager to learn and apply my skills in a professional environment.

Earlier in my academic career, I spent four years studying mechanical engineering before deciding to transition into software and system design. Making that switch wasn't easy, but it was the right move, one that allowed me to pursue a path more aligned with how I think and what I love to build.

## ACADEMIC BACKGROUND & COURSEWORK

During my mechanical engineering studies at the University of Pretoria, I built a strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving. I completed advanced mathematics including calculus through triple integration and linear differential equations, which developed my quantitative reasoning skills. The program covered core engineering principles like mechanics (statics and dynamics), thermodynamics, and structural design, alongside materials sciences and manufacturing processes. I also gained exposure to electrical and electronics fundamentals, working with both DC and AC circuitry, and developed technical communication skills essential for engineering documentation and collaboration.

My transition to computing at Belgium Campus has been highly complementary to this engineering background. I've delved deep into database systems, working extensively with MSSQL, Oracle, and MongoDB, which aligns perfectly with data-driven software solutions. The object-oriented programming coursework in C# has given me solid software architecture foundations, while web programming has expanded my full-stack capabilities. Machine learning has been particularly engaging - I've worked with neural networks, trained and deployed various ML models including linear models, and gained hands-on experience with the entire ML pipeline from data preparation to model deployment.

The program has also covered essential enterprise software concepts like linear programming for optimization problems, computer architecture for understanding system performance, and network development for distributed systems. Data warehousing concepts have been invaluable for understanding large-scale data management, and the Internet of Things coursework has given me insight into connected systems and sensor data processing - all highly relevant for building comprehensive business solutions.

This combination of engineering rigor and modern software development practices gives me a unique perspective when approaching complex technical challenges, especially in industrial and enterprise software contexts.

Beyond academic coursework, I've applied these skills in real-world projects. I built a comprehensive full-stack diary system for Coastal Hire using PostgreSQL, Python, and Next.js to streamline their scheduling and resource allocation processes. I also developed AI-driven reporting capabilities for their CRM system, leveraging local LLMs through Ollama for intelligent data analysis and automated business insights. To enhance workflow efficiency, I implemented automation solutions using N8N to connect various business processes and reduce manual data entry across their operations.
