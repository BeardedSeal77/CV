hey claude, could you please go through each web page in the project and change the content of each page?

make sure to go through public\Website Design.md for guidance on what works for CVs and Websites.

Something I want changed.

I want the content to be more humble, less overselling and promising, I am not the solution to all their problems.

I want humble, understated prowess and power. I want it to be stoic.

this is simply working on the content itself.
